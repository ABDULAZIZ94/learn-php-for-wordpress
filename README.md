WordPress makes it easy to create content-rich websites, with powerful admin pages and the easy-to-use Customizer. However, there will come a time when the built-in options aren't enough and you'll need to modify a theme or create your own plugin. That's where PHP comes in. PHP is the programming languge that WordPress is built in, and if you want to take your WordPress skills to the next level, you'll have to learn PHP.

In this course, Rachel McCollin will give you an overview of what PHP is and how it's used for WordPress themes and plugins, with examples. You'll go on to learn how to create a PHP file and use it to output HTML.
